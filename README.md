## Introduction

Why Space? Ive always been intrigued with space, the planets, their moons and the possibility of life other than us humans. So much so, I named my Dog Astro _(after astronology, although he does resemble Astro from The Jetsons)_. I recently had the most motivating application project for an internship that I hope to land and this will stem from that project. I never had the opprotunity to work with APIs and this one project helped me learn how to receive and display information gathered from different APIs. _More information on the APIs used below._

## Description

This website displays random facts and information about space and related information I find interesting. There should be a mix of information being gathered from different APIs such as NASA & SpaceX. The navigation bar should lead you to specific topics rather than all the information be laid out in home page.

## Where to view

Deployed link is coming soon!
